    <p>You need to run set_pg every time you restart your workspace
        Type \q and then press ENTER to quit psql.   PostgreSQL 11, the keywords "quit" and "exit" in the PostgreSQL
        command-line interface have been included to help make it easier to leave the command-line tool</p>
    <br>   
    
    <p>Next, we need to start the Postgres command-line interface, or shell, in order to get the Chinook
        database installed, and the data populated.</p>
    <br>
    <p>To launch the Postgres CLI, we can simply type "psql" and hit enter.
        To view, or list, any databases in our environment, we can type \l.
        By default, the Postgres CLI comes with 3 databases out of the box; 'postgres', 'template0', and 'template1'.
        Instead of using any of these default databases, let's create a new database for our Chinook lessons.
        CREATE DATABASE chinook; Don't forget the semicolon at the end of the command,
        which is the standard way to separate each SQL statement, since you can theoretically
        combine multiple commands in a single entry.
        If you've hit enter without adding the semicolon, it will assume you're wanting to add additional
        commands, so just add your semicolon now, and hit enter.
        We now have a fourth database, called Chinook, which is currently empty.
        If we needed to switch between databases, we can simply type \c followed by the name
        of the database we want to switch over to.
        \c postgres - now we're on the default postgres database.
        \c chinook - and now we're connected to our new database.
        The \c stands for 'connect' in case you're wondering, telling it which database to connect to.
        Finally, while we're connected to our new chinook database, we need to initialize or
        install the downloaded sample Chinook PostgreSQL database.
       <strong> \i Chinook_PostgreSql.sql </strong>The \i generally means include, integrate, install, or initialize.
        Essentially, this file is an SQL script that contains all of the instructions needed to
        create tables, and populate our database with information so that we have useful data for practice.
        We don't need to fully understand what it's doing right now; it's just so you know that
        it's giving us data to work with and test.
        We would encourage you later to go back and read through the script a bit, and have a
        look at some of the commands involved.
        This will take about 5 minutes to build our database tables.
    </p>
    <p>'psql -d chinook' . This will start the server, and tell it that
        the database we want to connect to is the one called "chinook", as declared by using
        the -d flag to specify a database name.Next, we need to confirm that all tables and data were successfully added to the database.
        '\dt' . This will allow us to display tables on our database.

    </p>

    <p>First, let's start by retrieving all data from the Artist table.
        Technically you don't need to write the SQL commands in capital letters, but it's standard
        practice to distinguish between the different pieces of your query string.
        The asterisk is a common programming method to signify a wildcard, which essentially means
        to select anything and everything.
        Also note, I've used double-quotes intentionally, because using single-quotes will throw a 'syntax error',
        Finally, the command must end with a semicolon, to specify that this is the end of our query.
        If you omit the semicolon and hit enter, nothing happens, but in reality, it's waiting for
        you to finish building your query, which can span multiple lines.
        Just add the missing semicolon and hit enter, and your query should still work fine.
   
        SELECT * FROM "artist";
</p>
<br>
<p>In order to exit this query search, simply type the letter "q" and hit enter, but not
    to be confused with \q which will quit the Postgres CLI. <strong>As you may have noticed, I've used double-quotes again, except when it comes to the specific
        value I'd like to search for, which must be in single-quotes.This is to distinguish between the various table and column names, versus the specific
        context or value I need to find.</strong>
</p>
<p>chinook=# SELECT *FROM "artist";
    chinook=# SELECT "name" FROM "artist";
    chinook=# SELECT * FROM "artist" WHERE "name" = 'Queen';
artist_id | name  
-----------+-------
51 | Queen
(1 row)


chinook=# SELECT * FROM "artist" WHERE "artist_id" = 66;
Since 51 is a primary key and integer, we don't need the single-quotes, but it will
still work if you include them.
</p>
<p>chinook=# SELECT * FROM "album" WHERE "artist_id"= 51;
    album_id |       title       | artist_id
   ----------+-------------------+-----------
          36 | Greatest Hits II  |        51
         185 | Greatest Hits I   |        51
         186 | News Of The World |        51
   (3 rows)
   This link or connection, referencing the primary key from another table, is known as a foreign key,
   and demonstrates that these tables are related, hence the name, relational database.
</p>
<br>
<p> SELECT * FROM "track" WHERE "composer" = 'Queen';
    You can see that only 9 tracks are listed, all of which belong to the "Greatest Hits 2" album,
    as specified by the foreign key of 36 under AlbumId, that we saw from the last query.
    The other columns here contain additional data about those tracks, some of which have
    foreign keys related to different tables on our database.
    In a real-world scenario, you should probably consider making the Composer column actually
    be the ArtistId foreign key, to keep with the relational database schema.</p>
    <br>
    <p>PsycoPG2 is by far the most popular, and stable library for connecting Python to Postgres.
        It's used by pretty much most Python and Postgres frameworks globally, including Django, which Not only does it support Python's primary versions, but it's also actively maintained
        and widely used in the development world when working with back-end databases.</p>
    <p>Before we can start using this adapter, we need to install it into our workspace.
        pip3 install psycopg2
        Once that's installed, we're going to use its built-in API to access our Chinook database, Once that's installed, we're going to use its built-in API to access our Chinook database,
        and we'll do that by using a Python file, not the CLI this time.</p>
    <p>Let's create a new Python file using the <strong> "touch" command, and call it 'sql-psycopg2.py',</strong>
        <br>
        It's important to note that you shouldn't call your file psycopg2.py, as this is a default
file already used by the package, and will cause your queries to always fail.
This is due to the fact that Python will confuse your custom file by the same name, as the
file from the package, and attempt to execute the wrong one.
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>'import psycopg2'</li>
    <li>psycopg2 connect to our Postgres database called Chinook, using
        the .connect() method.</li>
    <li>assign that to a variable of 'connection'</li>
    <li>We are only specifying the name of our database, "chinook", in double-quotes, but you could
        include additional connection values such as host, username, password, and so on.Since we are already working locally, and haven't set up any credentials, the only thing
        that we need to worry about is the actual database name.</li>
    <li>Cursor Object.
        A cursor object is another way of saying a 'set' or 'list', similar to an 'array' in JavaScript.
        Essentially, anything that we query from the database will become part of this cursor object,
        and to read that data, we should iterate over the cursor using a for-loop, as an example.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before we start to query the database, we need to set up a way for our data to be retrieved,
    or fetched, from the cursor.  'results' since it'll fetch any result that gets queried.if we need to query multiple records from our database, we should use the
    .fetchall() method.
    Otherwise, if we're intentionally looking for one particular record, we could use the
    .fetchone() method, which I will comment-out for now using the CTRL+/ command.once our results have been fetched, we need to end the connection to the database,
    so the connection isn't always persistent.</p>
    

<p>PsycoPG2 commands are actually quite similar to native SQL commands, with one little twist;
    the precise use of quotations.
    It's extremely important to note that we absolutely must use single-quotes to wrap our query,
    and double-quotes to specify particular values.</p>
