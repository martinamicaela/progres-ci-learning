<p>You need to run set_pg every time you restart your workspace
    Type \q and then press ENTER to quit psql.   PostgreSQL 11, the keywords "quit" and "exit" in the PostgreSQL 
    command-line interface have been included to help make it easier to leave the command-line tool</p>
<p>Next, we need to start the Postgres command-line interface, or shell, in order to get the Chinook
    database installed, and the data populated.
    To launch the Postgres CLI, we can simply type "psql" and hit enter.</p>
    <h3>To launch the Postgres CLI, we can simply type "psql" and hit enter.
        To view, or list, any databases in our environment, we can type \l.
        By default, the Postgres CLI comes with 3 databases out of the box; 'postgres', 'template0', and 'template1'.
        Instead of using any of these default databases, let's create a new database for our Chinook lessons.
        CREATE DATABASE chinook; Don't forget the semicolon at the end of the command,
        which is the standard way to separate each SQL statement, since you can theoretically
        combine multiple commands in a single entry.
        If you've hit enter without adding the semicolon, it will assume you're wanting to add additional
        commands, so just add your semicolon now, and hit enter.
        We now have a fourth database, called Chinook, which is currently empty.
        If we needed to switch between databases, we can simply type \c followed by the name
        of the database we want to switch over to.
        \c postgres - now we're on the default postgres database.
        \c chinook - and now we're connected to our new database.
        The \c stands for 'connect' in case you're wondering, telling it which database to connect to.
        Finally, while we're connected to our new chinook database, we need to initialize or
        install the downloaded sample Chinook PostgreSQL database.
        \i Chinook_PostgreSql.sql The \i generally means include, integrate, install, or initialize.
        Essentially, this file is an SQL script that contains all of the instructions needed to
        create tables, and populate our database with information so that we have useful data for practice.
        We don't need to fully understand what it's doing right now; it's just so you know that
        it's giving us data to work with and test.
        We would encourage you later to go back and read through the script a bit, and have a
        look at some of the commands involved.
        This will take about 5 minutes to build our database tables, so feel free to grab yourself
        a fresh cup of tea, or stand up and stretch a bit away from the keyboard.
        In the next lesson, we'll check to ensure that our data was populated correctly, and
        see how to query the database using some basic commands.
